        <p class="lead mb-4">Brian Gutierrez is a candidate for B.A. in Political Science and will be graduating in June 2022 from University of California, Riverside - College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. His coursework has surrounded mostly on topics such as Ethnic Politics, Immigration, Race, Labor & Globalization. Which has allowed Brian to be well-versed and determined in his future endeavors of becoming an Immigration Lawyer. Additionally, Brian is an active member of Phi Alpha Delta Pre-Law Fraternity, which has allowed him to participate in frequent webinars, mentorships, organizational activities, and community outreach programs/strategies. PAD has provided Brian a foundation in understanding different law focuses, law school processes, opportunities for involvement, and 1 on 1 interviews from practicing lawyers. Brian’s willingness to push in aiding his community and forging a new path forward is his goal in achieving breakthrough success and growth within his chosen field.
<br><br>

        Aside from academics, Brian’s professional development also stems from his work experience during college. In Shake Shack, Brian worked as a Restaurant Team Member and exercised different roles and responsibilities according to “Shack’s Standards”. He was a jack of all trades, which depends on what the team needed. This included cooking, prepping ingredients, cashier, front of the house, or making milkshakes. By working in Shake Shack, Brian has learned to adapt to a fast-paced environment with heavy customer traffic while also prioritizing the customer's experience. Lastly, Brian has also had experience in training and counseling new team members in different kitchen positions in order to build a high-performing and efficient team. Similarly, Brian has also worked at Bibigo which demonstrated his knowledge of the menu in order to recommend items to customers, provide alternatives to guests with dietary restrictions, and ensure sales goals were met. Bibigo provided skills in understanding daily financial transactions, ensuring records were accurate, and meeting specific quotas each day. Lastly, Brian has worked at Target as a Technology Consultant. Brian has mastered store tools to best understand store sales goals, top and bottom departments, inventory levels, top shortage categories, and guest traffic and peak times. His development has also pushed him to research current top sellers and current technology trends to better assist guests in finding the right technology solutions and accessories. Brian’s experiences in Restaurant and Retail jobs have provided him with key qualities in ensuring he understands and adapts to the environment he works in, administering and facilitating operations, people skills, prioritizing equity and understanding, while also staying focused and relevant to current tasks at hand.
